# Module_12_Challenge

# Creditworthiness

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I am using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Credit risk poses a classification problem that is inherently imbalanced due to healthy loans outnumbering risky loans. I am using various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes.

I have created a Jupyter notebook and Credit Risk Analysis Report. I have used text and comments to document my findings.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following modules:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For reading data into a DataFrame and analyzing data via statistics and plots.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - For embedding plots in the application.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html#) - For machine learning.

* [imbalance-learn](https://pypi.org/project/imbalanced-learn/) - For re-sampling.

* [pydotplus](https://pypi.org/project/pydotplus/) - For providing a Python Interface to Graphvizâ€™s Dot language to render graphs.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install mkdocs
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
  conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
```

## Usage

To use the Creditworthiness application:

Clone the Module_12_Challenge repository from GitHub:

'git clone https://github.com/jpweldon/Module_12_Challenge.git'

Run the credit_risk_resampling.ipynb program.

Examine the data preperation and analysis. Read the text and comments that document my findings.

Open Credit_Risk_Analysis_Report.md.

View and read the Credit Risk Analysis Report.
